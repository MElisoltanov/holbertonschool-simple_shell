.SH NAME
hsh \- simple UNIX command interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
.br
.B echo "cmd" | hsh
.br
.B hsh < scriptfile
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a minimalist command-line shell built as part of Holberton School training. It supports interactive and non-interactive modes, tokenizes input on whitespace, resolves external commands through the
.BR PATH (7)
environment variable, and executes them in child processes via
.BR fork (2)
and
.BR execve (2),
waiting with
.BR waitpid (2).
A small set of built-ins is provided.

.SH OPTIONS
No command-line options are supported. Input is read from
.BR stdin .
When data is redirected or piped, the shell runs in non-interactive mode.

.SH COMMANDS
The following built-in commands are available:
.TP
.B exit [n]
Terminate the shell. If
.I n
is provided, it sets the internal exit status used by the shell loop.
.TP
.B env
Print the current environment (one variable per line).

.SH EXIT STATUS
In the current implementation the
.B hsh
process exits with status
.B 0
on normal termination. (If the program later returns the last commandâ€™s status from
.BR main ( ),
update this section accordingly.)

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The shell inherits its environment from the parent process. External commands are resolved using
.BR PATH .
The
.B env
built-in displays the environment.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Interactive session:
.B $ ./hsh
.br
.B $ ls -l
.br
.B $ exit
.TP
Non-interactive (pipeline):
.B $ echo "ls -l" | ./hsh
.TP
Non-interactive (redirected file):
.B $ ./hsh < scriptfile

.SH BUGS
Issues are under active investigation. Please report problems to the authors.
